# cdk-eventbridge-to-stepfunctions

:fire: do not use, this is not ready for primetime

This is a CDK construct library that allows you to easily create an EventBridge rule that sends events to a Step Functions state machine.

But, what about Eventbridge Pipes? Event Bridge Pipes are great, but Step Functions support is limited as of this writing. The sole purpose of this construct is to have human readable step function invocation entries.
